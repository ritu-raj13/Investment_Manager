### Managing Portfolio

**Setting Up Total Amount (for % Allocation):**

**📖 For complete API documentation, see [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md)**

### Quick Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/stocks` | GET | List all stocks |
| `/api/stocks` | POST | Add new stock (auto-fetches details) |
| `/api/stocks/refresh-prices` | POST | Refresh all stock prices |
| `/api/stocks/refresh-alert-stocks` | POST | Refresh only alert stocks |
| `/api/portfolio/transactions` | GET/POST | Manage transactions |
| `/api/portfolio/summary` | GET | Portfolio P&L summary |

| `/api/export/stocks` | GET | Export stocks to CSV |

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Stock Symbols
- **NSE stocks**: Add `.NS` suffix (e.g., `RELIANCE.NS`, `TCS.NS`)
- **BSE stocks**: Add `.BO` suffix (e.g., `RELIANCE.BO`)

### Price Updates
- Click "Refresh Prices" once a day
- Takes 10-30 seconds for 10-20 stocks
- Be patient - web scraping needs time

### Portfolio Tracking
- Record every transaction with reason
- Use notes to document your analysis
- Review performance weekly/monthly

### Organization
- Use Groups for trading patterns (Bull Run, Cup with Handle, etc.)
- Use Sector for industry classification (FMCG, Banking, IT, etc.)
- **Price Zones support ranges**: Enter "250-300" or exact "275"
- Set realistic buy/sell zones based on your analysis
- Update status as markets move

### Portfolio Allocation
- Set your **Total Portfolio Amount** to track planned allocation
- Monitor **% of Total** column to see stock-wise distribution
- Rebalance when any stock exceeds your target allocation
- Example: If you plan 10% in tech but have 15% → consider rebalancing

## 🔄 Database Migration

If you have existing data and need to update the database schema:

```bash
cd backend
python db_migrator.py
```

The universal migrator will:
- Auto-detect missing columns and add them
- Convert column types if needed (e.g., zones to support ranges)
- Create backup before migration
- Run safely multiple times (idempotent)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Check if port 5000 is free
- Activate virtual environment
- Install all requirements

### Frontend won't start
- Check if port 3000 is free
- Run `npm install` again
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall

### Prices not fetching
- Check internet connection
- Wait a few seconds between refreshes
- Web scraping may be temporarily blocked (wait and retry)

### Database errors
- Run `python migrate_db.py` to update schema
- Or delete `investment_manager.db` to start fresh
